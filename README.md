# Tic-Tac-Toe
In this project, a game of Tic-Tac-Toe was created using tkinter GUI in python. In order to
improve the user interface and user experience a two frame application was made. The first
frame served the purpose of a welcome page to the game for the users and asked the names
of the players. When the players submitted their details, the frame containing the actual
game got loaded. The players could then enjoy the game of tic-tac-toe by clicking on a
button from the available grid to play their turn. Once the game got over, the players had
the option to restart the game by clicking on the redirect button which redirected the
application to the welcome page where the users could enter the details again and start a
new game afresh.
